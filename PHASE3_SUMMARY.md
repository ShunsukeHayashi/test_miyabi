## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API Key Exposure | Use Next.js API routes only |
| Performance Issues | Lazy loading, code splitting |
| Testing Complexity | Agent-generated tests, early start |
| Deployment Failures | Preview deployments, local testing |
| Responsive Design Bugs | Real device testing |

---

## Execution Commands

### Start Agent Execution
```bash
npm run agents:parallel:exec -- --phase=3 --concurrency=4
```

### Monitor Progress
```bash
npx miyabi status --watch
```

### Generate Report
```bash
npx miyabi report --phase=3
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Next.js 15?
- Built-in SSR/SSG for better performance
- App Router for modern React patterns
- API routes for secure backend integration
- Best-in-class TypeScript support

### Why shadcn/ui?
- Copy-paste components (no dependency bloat)
- Full customization control
- Built on Radix UI (accessible by default)
- Tailwind CSS integration

### Why Zustand?
- Minimal boilerplate vs Redux
- Excellent TypeScript inference
- Built-in persistence middleware
- No context providers needed

### Why Vercel?
- Seamless Next.js integration
- Edge functions for fast API routes
- Automatic preview deployments
- Built-in analytics

### Application
- `web/` - Next.js application directory
- `web/app/` - Pages (generate, edit, batch, history, settings)
- `web/components/` - Reusable React components
- `web/lib/` - Utilities, API client, state store
- `web/hooks/` - Custom React hooks

### Testing
- `tests/components/` - Vitest component tests
- `tests/hooks/` - Vitest hook tests
- `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end tests
- Coverage reports (HTML + JSON)

### Deployment
- Live production URL (e.g., `byteflow.vercel.app`)
- Vercel Analytics dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions + Vercel)

## Next Steps

1. **Approve Plan:** Review and approve this implementation plan
2. **Execute:** Run `npm run agents:parallel:exec -- --phase=3 --concurrency=4`
3. **Monitor:** Watch progress with `npx miyabi status --watch`
4. **Review:** Inspect deliverables at each milestone
5. **Deploy:** Final production deployment to Vercel

---

## Shikigaku Theory Alignment

### 1. Responsibility Clarity
Each agent has clear, non-overlapping responsibilities for their assigned tasks.

### 2. Authority Delegation
Agents make all technical decisions autonomously within task scope.

### 3. Hierarchy Design
CoordinatorAgent → CodeGenAgent/TestAgent/DeploymentAgent (clear chain of command)

### 4. Result Evaluation
Quantitative success criteria (test coverage, Lighthouse scores, performance metrics)

### 5. Ambiguity Elimination
Explicit DAG dependencies, no overlapping tasks, clear escalation paths

---

**Plan Approval:** Pending
**Start Date:** TBD (after approval)
**End Date:** 10 days after start
**Point of Contact:** CoordinatorAgent
